I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/) (RICAM), working on machine learning research. 

My research interests are Domain Adaptation, Machine Learning, Learning Theory, and Inverse Problems.

Previously, I was a PhD student at [Johannes Kepler University](https://www.jku.at/) and RICAM, advised by [Prof. Dr. Sergei Pereverzyev](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/staff/sergei-pereverzyev), [Priv.-Doz. Dr. Bernhard Moser](https://www.scch.at/team/bernhard.moser), and [Dr. Werner Zellinger](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/ricam/staff/werner-zellinger). My PhD research focused on analyzing the use of general regularization schemes in the scenario of unsupervised domain adaptation under the so-called covariate shift assumption.

Aside from mathematics, Iâ€™m interested in playing badminton and watching football.
