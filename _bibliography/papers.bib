  abstract = {We analyze the use of the so-called general regularization scheme in the scenario of unsupervised domain adaptation under the covariate shift assumption. Learning algorithms arising from the above scheme are generalizations of importance weighted regularized least squares method, which up to now is among the most used approaches in the covariate shift setting. We explore a link between the considered domain adaptation scenario and estimation of Radon-Nikodym derivatives in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, where the general regularization scheme can also be employed and is a generalization of the kernelized unconstrained least-squares importance fitting. We estimate the convergence rates of the corresponding regularized learning algorithms and discuss how to resolve the issue with the tuning of their regularization parameters. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical examples, one of which is based on real data collected for automatic stenosis detection in cervical arteries.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
